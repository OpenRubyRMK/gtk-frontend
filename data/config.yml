# Global configuration file for the OpenRubyRMK
# =============================================
#
# This is the OpenRubyRMK’s GTK client configuration file.
# It’s a simple, human-readable and editable file in YAML
# format and you’re welcome to adjust the settings to your
# needs. Generally, "on" activates a feature, and "off"
# turns it off, any options requiring other values are
# described accordingly.
#
# Default values are indicated with double hash signs ##.

# Locale to display the GUI in. Leave empty to determine the
# value from the environment. Example:
# locale: de
## (empty)
locale:

# Wether or not to display the map grid by default.
## off
grid: off

# Whether or not to remember the positions of the
# windows on exiting so they can be restored on
# the next start. If your window manager already
# does this, you probably don’t want to set this.
## off
remember_window_positions: off

# Activate if you want layers above the current one
# to fade out.
## on
alpha_layers: on

# Activating this option makes the map highlight
# the cell the cursor is currently hovering over.
# Note activating this option currently is very
# intense on your CPU, hence off by default.
## off
show_active_cell: off
