# Menu entries. Pro tip: Prefixing a letter with an underscore
# (_) makes that letter a so-called "mnemonic". These are generally
# underlined in the UI and allow to navigate the menus by only using
# the keyboard, i.e. [ALT]+<mnemonic> to activate an entry. Each
# menu entry should have such a mnemonic letter, and they should
# be unique within a submenu. You don’t have to copy the exact
# mnemonics from the English version for your translation, choose
# more apropriate ones.
