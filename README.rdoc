= OpenRubyRMK frontend

This is the GUI frontend component of the OpenRubyRMK, building upon the
facilities that the
{openrubyrmk-backend}[http://devel.pegasus-alpha.eu/projects/openrubyrmk-backend]
library provides.

== How to start the development version

You need to install inkscape[http://www.inkscape.org] and have it
available in your path for the second step below. After you have
created the PNG files, you can remove inkscape if you donâ€™t like it.

  $ bundle install
  $ bundle exec rake pngs
  $ ./bin/openrubyrmk-gtk
